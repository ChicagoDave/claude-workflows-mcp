# Session Context: 2025-08-28 11:27

## Session Summary
Organized and expanded the Claude development workflows book in docs/book, removing project-specific references to make it generic and adding missing workflow patterns identified from archived context files.

## Work Completed

### Documentation Organization
- ✅ **Archived non-workflow files**: Moved 6 older files (outlines, samples, templates) to `docs/book/archive/`
- ✅ **Created README.md**: Added navigation guide and workflow sequence diagram for the book directory
- ✅ **Removed project-specific references**: Eliminated all Sharpee and TypeScript references from workflow documents to make them generic

### New Workflows Created
- ✅ **Refactoring Workflow** (`workflow-refactoring.md`): 
  - Systematic approach to improving existing code
  - Includes current state analysis, problem documentation, solution design
  - Refactoring specification template with before/after comparisons
  - Common patterns and anti-patterns

- ✅ **Design Discussion Workflow** (`workflow-design-discussion.md`):
  - Structured comparison of multiple design options
  - Harvey Ball rating system (⬤ ◕ ◑ ◔ ○)
  - Weighted scoring matrices for decision-making
  - Scenario analysis tables
  - Documents saved to `docs/discussions/dd-XXX-description.md`

### Integration Updates
- ✅ **Updated all overview documents**: Added new workflows to overview, README, and workflow diagrams
- ✅ **Cross-referenced workflows**: Added integration points between Design Mode, Design Discussions, and ADRs
- ✅ **Updated directory structures**: Added `docs/discussions/` to documentation structure

## Key Decisions & Discoveries

### Decision: Generic Documentation
- **What**: Removed all project-specific references (Sharpee, TypeScript)
- **Why**: Makes the book universally applicable to any Claude development project
- **Impact**: Book can be used with any language, framework, or domain

### Discovery: Missing Workflow Patterns
- **Found**: Several workflow patterns in archived context files not covered in main workflows
- **Action**: Created Refactoring and Design Discussion workflows to fill gaps
- **Result**: More comprehensive coverage of real development scenarios

### Pattern: Documentation Hierarchy
- **ADRs**: For significant, hard-to-reverse decisions
- **Design Discussions**: For systematic comparison of options
- **Refactor Specs**: For improving existing code
- **Session Context**: For continuity between sessions

## Modified Files

### Critical Changes
- `docs/book/README.md`: Created comprehensive navigation guide
- `docs/book/workflow-refactoring.md`: New refactoring workflow
- `docs/book/workflow-design-discussion.md`: New design discussion workflow
- `docs/book/workflows-overview.md`: Updated with new workflows and diagrams

### Supporting Changes
- All workflow files: Removed project-specific references
- `workflow-design-mode-adr.md`: Added Design Discussion integration
- 6 files moved to `archive/`: Old templates and outlines

## Current State

### Git Status
```bash
Branch: main
Modified files: ~15 workflow documents
New files: 3 (README, refactoring, design-discussion)
Archived files: 6 (in docs/book/archive/)
```

## Workflow Coverage
Complete workflow system now covers:
- Project setup and standards
- Design exploration and decisions
- Design comparison and evaluation
- Planning and implementation
- Refactoring existing code
- Documentation and review
- Session management

## Next Session Starting Point

### Immediate Actions
1. Review the complete workflow set for any remaining gaps
2. Consider creating example/case study documents
3. Test workflows with a real project scenario

### Potential Enhancements
- Create workflow quick reference card
- Add workflow selection guide (which workflow when)
- Create templates directory with ready-to-use formats
- Consider workflow for dependency updates
- Consider workflow for debugging/troubleshooting

## Important Context

### Completed Book Structure
The Claude development workflows book is now:
- **Generic**: No project-specific references
- **Comprehensive**: Covers full development lifecycle
- **Integrated**: Workflows reference each other appropriately
- **Practical**: Includes templates and examples

### Documentation Locations
- **ADRs**: `docs/architecture/adrs/adr-XXX-description.md`
- **Design Discussions**: `docs/discussions/dd-XXX-description.md`
- **Refactor Specs**: Inline in refactoring workflow or `docs/work/`
- **Session Contexts**: `docs/context/end-session-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md`

## Questions for Next Session

- [ ] Should we create a workflow for dependency management?
- [ ] Should we add a troubleshooting/debugging workflow?
- [ ] Do we need a workflow for documentation updates?
- [ ] Should we create example documents showing each workflow in action?

## Session Metrics

- **Duration**: ~2 hours
- **Files Modified**: 15+
- **New Workflows Created**: 2 (Refactoring, Design Discussion)
- **Files Archived**: 6
- **References Cleaned**: All Sharpee/TypeScript mentions removed

## Notes & Observations

### What Worked Well
- Systematic review of all files for project-specific references
- Using archived context files to identify missing patterns
- Clear separation between different documentation types (ADR vs DD)

### Patterns Recognized
- Workflows often trigger other workflows (Design → Discussion → ADR)
- Documentation serves different purposes at different decision levels
- Harvey Ball ratings provide good visual comparison tool

### Book Completeness
The workflow book now comprehensively covers the Claude development lifecycle and can serve as a standalone guide for any project using Claude for development assistance.
